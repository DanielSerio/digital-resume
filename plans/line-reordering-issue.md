# Work Experience Line Reordering Issue - September 14, 2025

## Status: FRONTEND ERROR BOUNDARY ISSUE (Backend API Fixed ✅)

### Problem
Work experience line reordering doesn't persist after save/reload. Additionally, WorkExperienceSection component triggers ErrorBoundary preventing access to the feature.

### Investigation Results - Latest Session

#### ✅ Backend API - FULLY FIXED
- **Database Schema**: Fixed to use `sortOrder` instead of `lineId` consistently
- **API Response Format**: Backend now returns `lines` instead of `workExperienceLines`
- **Data Consistency**: Removed ALL `lineId` references throughout codebase
- **API Endpoint**: `/api/work-experiences` working correctly, returning proper structure:
  ```json
  {
    "id": 5,
    "lines": [
      {
        "id": 19,
        "sortOrder": 1,
        "lineText": "Led development of microservices..."
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
- **Service Methods**: Consolidated to always handle lines, proper data transformation

#### ✅ Data Flow - FIXED
- **Network Layer**: API calls successfully return expected data format
- **Date Transformation**: Added proper string-to-Date conversion in useWorkExperiencesData hook
- **Type Safety**: Frontend types match API response structure

#### ❌ Frontend Component - CURRENT ISSUE
- **ErrorBoundary**: WorkExperienceSection component triggers ErrorBoundary
- **Root Cause**: Unknown - could be React render issue, type mismatch, or component logic error
- **Impact**: Cannot test line reordering functionality due to component crash

### Session Summary
- **Duration**: Extended debugging session with multiple rate limit pauses
- **Major Fixes**: Complete backend data consistency, API format standardization
- **Remaining Issue**: Frontend component error preventing feature access
- **Status**: Backend architecture restored, frontend requires component-level debugging

### Technical Changes Made
- **Database**: Complete schema migration to use `sortOrder`
- **Backend Services**: Consolidated update methods, fixed response transformation
- **API Layer**: Standardized response format for frontend compatibility
- **Frontend Hooks**: Added date transformation, error handling improvements

### Next Steps
1. Debug WorkExperienceSection ErrorBoundary trigger
2. Identify specific component/render issue causing crash
3. Test line reordering persistence once component error resolved
4. Verify sortOrder changes persist through complete workflow

### Code Health
- **Backend**: Fully functional, proper data structure
- **API**: Working correctly, consistent response format
- **Database**: Clean schema with proper field naming
- **Frontend**: Component-level error requiring targeted debugging

### Conclusion
Significant progress made on backend architecture and data consistency. The core API functionality is restored and working correctly. The remaining issue is isolated to the frontend component layer and requires focused React debugging to identify the ErrorBoundary trigger.
