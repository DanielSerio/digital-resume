# Phase 6 Implementation Q&A

This document addresses key questions about Phase 6: Advanced Features implementation to guide development decisions.

## üéØ Scoped Resume Management (6.1)

### Q1: What's the current state of scoped resume functionality?

**Current State Analysis:**

- ‚úÖ **Backend Complete**: All database models (scoped_resumes, scoped_professional_summaries, scoped_skills, scoped_work_experiences, scoped_work_experience_lines)
- ‚úÖ **API Endpoints**: Full CRUD operations and nested content endpoints
- ‚úÖ **Basic Frontend**: `/scoped` route with selector and basic management (create, duplicate, delete)
- ‚ùå **Missing**: Content filtering interfaces and copy-on-write editing UI

**Suggested Answer:** We have solid foundation infrastructure. Phase 6 should focus on building the user-facing filtering interfaces and copy-on-write editing experiences on top of the existing backend.

### Q2: For skill/work experience filtering (6.1.3-6.1.4), should this be checkbox-based or more sophisticated?

**Suggested Answer:** **Checkbox-based selection with search/filter capabilities**

- **Skills**: Group by category with expand/collapse, search bar for quick filtering
- **Work Experience**: List view with checkboxes per experience, with ability to select individual accomplishment lines
- **Benefits**: Simple UX, clear visual feedback, works well with existing data structure

**Implementation Priority:** Start with basic checkbox interface, enhance with search later.

### Q3: Copy-on-write editing - automatic or explicit action?

**Suggested Answer:** **Automatic with clear visual indicators**

- When user edits content in scoped resume, automatically create scoped version
- Show visual indicator (e.g., colored border, "customized" badge) to indicate content differs from original
- Provide "reset to original" button to remove customizations
- **Benefits**: Seamless UX, preserves original data integrity, clear feedback

## üè¢ Work Experience Management (6.2)

### Q4: Line ordering - different from Phase 4 implementation?

**Current State Check:** Need to verify what's already implemented in WorkExperienceSection.

**Suggested Answer:** **Build upon existing implementation**

- If basic up/down exists, enhance with drag-and-drop (future)
- If not implemented, start with up/down arrow buttons
- Focus on persistence and smooth animations
- **Priority**: Ensure ordering persists across sessions and scoped resume filtering

### Q5: Markdown preview - inline or toggle mode?

**Suggested Answer:** **Toggle mode with live preview**

- Split view: Edit on left, preview on right (on larger screens)
- Toggle button for smaller screens
- Support basic markdown: **bold**, _italic_, `code`, - lists
- **Benefits**: Familiar pattern, doesn't clutter interface, supports responsive design

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills Management (6.3)

### Q6: Hybrid dropdowns - same as Phase 4 or enhanced?

**Suggested Answer:** **Abandon Hybrid dropdowns. We are not using these any more as it does not makes sense with our UI**

### Q7: Bulk skill operations - which operations?

**Suggested Answer:** **Priority operations based on user workflow**

1. **Bulk Delete**: Select multiple skills for removal
2. **Bulk Recategorize**: Move multiple skills to different category/subcategory
3. **Bulk Import**: Import skills from CSV/JSON or predefined tech stacks
4. **Bulk Export**: Export selected skills for backup/sharing

**Implementation Order**: Delete ‚Üí Recategorize ‚Üí Import ‚Üí Export

## üíæ Data Persistence (6.4)

### Q8: Auto-save scope and interaction with current save/cancel pattern?

**Suggested Answer:** **Do not implement Auto-save. The entire application should use explicit save**

- **important** Please remove all references to auto-saving from our documentation (including CLAUDE.md and our root README.md). This is not a feature we want

### Q9: Optimistic updates - which operations benefit most?

**Suggested Answer:** **Focus on frequent, low-risk operations**

1. **Skill additions/deletions**: Immediate UI update, rollback on error
2. **Line reordering**: Instant visual feedback, persist in background
3. **Text editing**: ~~Real-time updates with auto-save~~ **REMOVED - use explicit save**
4. **Category/subcategory creation**: Immediate availability in dropdowns

**Avoid optimistic updates for**: Work experience CRUD, contact info changes, scoped resume creation

## üöÄ Implementation Strategy

### Q10: Where should we start - implementation priority?

**Suggested Answer:** **Phased approach building on existing strengths**

**Phase 6A: Enhanced Work Experience (2-3 tasks)**

- 6.2.1: Add/remove work experience entries (extend existing components)
- 6.2.2: Work experience line management (build on existing)
- 6.2.3: Line ordering (complete existing implementation)

**Phase 6B: Skills Enhancement (2-3 tasks)**

- ~~6.3.1: Enhanced hybrid dropdowns~~ **REMOVED - see updated strategy below**
- 6.3.2: Skill grouping/filtering UI
- 6.3.4: Basic bulk operations (delete/recategorize)

### Q17: SkillsSection UI Consistency - should it match WorkExperience/Education pattern?

**Current Issue**: SkillsSection still uses outer edit button pattern while WorkExperience and Education sections have individual edit capabilities.

**Suggested Answer:** **Yes - implement consistent UI pattern across all sections**

**Required Changes to SkillsSection:**
- **Remove outer "Edit" button** (similar to WorkExperience/Education sections)
- **Always show "Add Skill" button** (no longer hidden behind edit mode)
- **Individual skill management**: Each skill category/group should have its own edit controls
- **Consistent with established pattern**: Matches user expectations from other sections

**Implementation Approach:**
- **Phase 1**: Remove outer edit mode, make "Add Skill" always visible
- **Phase 2**: Add individual skill edit/delete controls per skill item
- **Phase 3**: Implement category-level edit controls (rename category, manage subcategories)

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **UI Consistency**: All sections follow same interaction pattern
- ‚úÖ **Improved UX**: Users can add skills without entering "edit mode"
- ‚úÖ **Granular Control**: Edit individual skills without affecting others
- ‚úÖ **Matches User Mental Model**: Consistent with WorkExperience section behavior

**Task Priority**: This should be addressed **before** Phase 6B (Skills Enhancement) to establish proper foundation.
